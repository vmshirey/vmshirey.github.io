        <h4><strong>Vaughn Shirey</strong>, Teaching Philosophy</h4>
        <p>Keeping in the theme of experiential learning, I have had the opportunity to rewrite laboratory exercises for Global Change Ecology to include
		an introduction to R and the <i>tidyverse</i> package. By the end of this course, students (including non-majors) were able to conduct their own analyses
		of data with one student conducting her own natural language processesing research from scratch. In seeking to expand my skills in developing laboratories, I 
		partnered with teaching faculty at Georgetown to develop an entirely new community ecology lab for the introductory ecology course. In this lab, students were able
		to conduct actual field sampling of leaf-litter arthropod communities, learn arthropod identification, and calcuate diversity metrics from their samples. </p>
