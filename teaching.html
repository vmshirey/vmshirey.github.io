                        <img src="images/teaching1.png" class="floatLeft"><p>My goal as a scientific educator is to develop <b>powerful critical thinkers</b>, equipping learners with the <b>ability to rapidly synthesize past research and new data 
                            to ask questions and generate new knowledge</b> about our natural world. <b>Experiential, project-based learning is essential</b> to meet this goal and provide students with the 
                            tools to enable their success in their professional and personal lives. My own experiences as both an instructor and a learner have enforced this experiential practice 
                            of education for me and have allowed me to put these ideas into practice in the classroom setting. 
                        </p>
                        <p>During my Ph.D. studies at Georgetown University, I've had the opportunity to teach in various capacities. Formally, I served as a teaching fellow for general ecology and 
                            global climate change ecology. I wrote a laboratory exercise for general ecology focused on leaf-litter arthropod community identification and comparisons. This lab 
                            exercise has now been integrated into the regular general ecology curriculum at Georgetown and has been acclaimed by students as their favorite lab of the course. In 
                            the latter course I worked to develop new laboratory exercises focused on teaching data science skills to undergraduates. These labs included using code to write custom 
                            functions, check for dataset integrity, and examine how well statistical and mechanistic models predict plant phenology. I also developed a week-long lecture/lab series 
                            on species distribution modeling using machine-learning approaches. 
                        </p>
                        <p>This type of project-based learning transforms the classroom into a laboratory – giving the potential energy for students to jumpstart their lives by investigating questions 
                            that they are interested in under a particular topic. It also encourages students to work, share, and collaborate with one another, learning to depend on the strengths of 
                            the collective to generate new ideas and research outcomes. Working through a problem together fosters a strong sense of community around a topic area and can establish lasting 
                            friendship and collaboration. I’ve witnessed this firsthand in the laboratories that I’ve worked on; students who normally wouldn’t investigate anything remotely related to 
                            insects become curious as they look under a microscope to identify leaf-litter arthropod communities. My philosophy is simple and guided by my own research and desire to 
                            create – let classrooms be worlds where students can explore, make mistakes, and grow into a fulfilled version of themselves.

                        <p>One of my past mentees, Dr. Stephen Mason, now an assistant professor at Immaculata University, likes to point out one of my signature catch-phrases whenever we talk about mentorship 
                            together – “let’s have a look.” This phrase embodies my mindset that project-based co-learning with my students and mentees is the best approach for creating a vibrant scientific community. 
                            Working together towards a common goal of uncovering the mystery of life is what inspires me to be a biologist. So, what can we discover together?</p>
