									<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
									<p>My goal as a scientific educator is to <b>develop powerful critical thinkers</b>, equipping
                                        learners with the ability to rapidly <b>synthesize past research and new data</b> to ask questions and
                                        <b>generate new knowledge about our natural world</b>. Experiential, project-based learning is
                                        essential to meet this goal and provide students with the tools to enable their success in their
                                        professional and personal lives. My own experiences as both an instructor and a learner have
                                        enforced this experiential practice of education for me and have allowed me to put these ideas
                                        into practice in the classroom setting.</p>
									<p>During my studies at Georgetown University, I&#39;ve had the opportunity to teach in
                                        various capacities. Formally, I served as a teaching fellow for general ecology and global climate
                                        change ecology. I wrote a laboratory exercise for general ecology focused on leaf-litter arthropod
                                        community identification and comparisons. This lab exercise has now been integrated into the
                                        regular general ecology curriculum at Georgetown and has been acclaimed by students as their
                                        favorite lab of the course. In the latter course I worked to develop new laboratory exercises
                                        focused on teaching data science skills to undergraduates. These labs included using code to
                                        write custom functions, check for dataset integrity, and examine how well statistical and
                                        mechanistic models predict plant phenology. I also developed a week-long lecture/lab series on
                                        species distribution modeling using machine-learning approaches.</p>
                                    <p>This type of project-based learning transforms the classroom into a laboratory – giving
                                        the potential energy for students to jumpstart their lives by investigating questions that they are
                                        interested in under a particular topic. It also encourages students to work, share, and collaborate
                                        with one another, learning to depend on the strengths of the collective to generate new ideas and
                                        research outcomes. Working through a problem together fosters a strong sense of community
                                        around a topic area and can establish lasting friendship and collaboration. I’ve witnessed this
                                        firsthand in the laboratories that I’ve worked on; students who normally wouldn’t investigate
                                        anything remotely related to insects become curious as they look under a microscope to identify
                                        leaf-litter arthropod communities. My philosophy is simple and guided by my own research and
                                        desire to create – let classrooms be worlds where students can explore, make mistakes, and grow
                                        into a fulfilled version of themselves.</p>
                                    <p>One of my past mentees, now an assistant professor at Immaculata
                                        University, likes to point out one of my signature catch-phrases whenever we talk about
                                        mentorship together – “let’s have a look.” This phrase embodies my mindset that project-based
                                        co-learning with my students and mentees is the best approach for creating a vibrant scientific
                                        community. Working together towards a common goal of uncovering the mystery of life is what
                                        inspires me to be a biologist. So, what can we discover together?</p>
