                        <p>I have a strong belief that one of best approaches to learning is through hands-on experiences. Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to co-create learning 
                            experiences that center core data science practice and natural history - equipping students with the confidence to lead independent research projects in their own lives.

                                good at breaking things down to explain them and making sure students are with
                                him along the way. I also appreciated his clear enthusiasm for ecology!"</i> (Student | Ecology 2019)</li>
                            <li><i>"Vaughn's lecture was well-paced and clear. He is obviously passionate about his
                                work and makes the topic more stimulating for students. He is very helpful in review
                                sessions and if I didn't have class during his office hours I would have liked to
                                attend those."</i> (Student | Ecology 2019)</li>
                            <li><i>"Vaughn took the initiative to offer a review session the night before exams, and other than a
                                5-minute run-through of potential answers to posted practice questions did all of the
                                preparation for this. I certainly appreciated their willingness to take this on, and each
                                session had more students than the previous one so word clearly spread among the
                                students that this was a useful study aid."</i> (Teaching Professor | Ecology 2019)</li>
                            <li><i>"I really liked learning in the lab portion of this class. ...I liked seeing the applications of the work
                                we were going over in class and appreciated that most of the assignments were able to be finished within class time."</i> (Student | Global Change Ecology 2019)</li>
