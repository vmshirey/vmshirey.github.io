                            <p>The biogeography of global change requires us to be rapidly informed about species' range shifts, expansions, and contractions as well 
                                as general occupancy trends. Many of these metrics are best derived from structured sampling programs which make an effort to record 
                                detection/non-detection data and capture metrics of effort simultaenously. Unfortunately, such structured sampling is typically
                                 restricted to areas of high human population density or with greater ease of access (for example, roadsides) (you can read more 
                                 about this here and here). This prevents us from assessing trends in species' occupancy over time, especially where structured 
                                 sampling is sparse.</p>

                            <p>Despite this challenge, natural history collections may provide us with an opportunity to reconstruct historical ecologies from 
                                unstructured, largely incidental detection data. In order to use these data, analytical frameworks MUST account for a greatly 
                                heterogenous detection process given that museum specimens can/often end up in collections without the explicit intent of reflecting 
                                ecological communities. For example, many collections represent an amalgamation of specimens from taxonomic research, agricultural 
                                studies, and hobbyist collectors. Fortunately, occupancy-detection models are an already established framework for looking at 
                                occupancy trends given a overlying detection process (see more about occupancy-detection models here).</p>
                                
                            <p>I was fortunate to join the M'Gonigle lab group out at Simon-Fraser University over the latter part of 2021 since my own research 
                                focused on applying this framework to unstructured data in the North American boreal and Arctic regions. This jumpstarted a 
                                collaboration, eventually my second dissertation chapter, which examines some of the limitations of applying occupancy-detection 
                                models to natural history data. That research is now published at Methods in Ecology and Evolution (with major thanks to co-authors,

                        <li>Occupancy-detection models that compare two time periods to each other are generally bad practice and should be avoided. We recommend
                            using at least 5 time periods, but this will depend on your estimate of community visit probability (see below).
                        </li>
                        <li>The probability that a collector visited a site with the intent to observe all species in a community versus a single species is important
                            when considering eventual model error. The greater number of community focused visits, the lower the error of the model. We recommend at least
                            half of the data come from this type of sampling. Of course, this value is unknown in most datasets; however, we approximated it using spatiotemporal
                            clustering of all specimens collected on the same day within 1 kilometer of each other.
