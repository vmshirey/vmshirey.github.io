                        <h2>Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in the Classroom</h2>
                        <p>My path to graduate education was a rocky one. My public high school in my home state of Pennsylvania is ranked in the lowest 25% of high schools in the state for grade-level academic proficiency. This, coupled with 
                            undiagnosed obsessive-compulsive disorder and test anxiety until the age of 27, caused me to struggle in my pursuit of higher-education. These experiences have given me first-hand knowledge about how hard college can be
                            for learners who come from disadvantaged and neurodivergent backgrounds. Broadly, I believe in the following core policies for all coursework:
                            <ol>
                                <li><b>No mandatory attendance policies</b>: course attendance policies are ableist. While I expect proficient performance in coursework, I never expect a physical body in most classes. Let's be real and recognize that
                                students have lives outside of our courses, rent that needs to be paid, and time that needs to be spent recovering from illness or bereavement.</li>
                                <li><b>Parallelized, pre-recorded lectures</b>: instructional continuity and accessibility can work hand-in-hand. Pre-recording lecture material allows for students to review key material at their own pace. In addition, it
                                provides a record for personal reflection on teaching practice and areas of improvement as it pertains to delivering course material.</li>
                                <li><b>Built-in accommodation</b>: accommodation processes are long and often require students to seek out professionals with their own money and time. Building in buffers around examinations allows for students
                                to elect to take the exam over longer periods of time or in a quiet location without the need for formal accommodation paperwork.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p>While these core principles for instruction address issues related to accessibility, as a discipline, our instruction of biodiversity science is centered almost exclusively around whiteness. To combat this fallacy and 
                            we must work to highlight scientists from diverse backgrounds and those scientists who have gone on to successful careers outside of research.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in the Biodiversity Sciences</h2>
                        <p>
                            Biodiversity science, broadly encompassing the fields of ecology and evolution, is deeply rooted in the othering, oppression, and colonial/racist violence of our modern history. Reconciling this 
                            history with the fact that today, Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color (BIPOC) are still hugely underrepresented in the biodiversity sciences. Effort through direct action and advocacy must 
                            be made from all those in positions of power in order to move our discipline into a more just future. From my perspective, a just discipline must be able to face difficult conversations head-on. It must give power to people who have historically been outcast, and it requires that those with power participate
                            in <b>direct action</b>, <b>mutual aid</b>, and <b>community building</b> within their research and teaching practice. 
                        </p> 
                        <p>At Georgetown, I've had the opportunity to address some of these ideas through my role as the <b>grievance officer for our graduate workers' union</b>, the Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Employees (GAGE).
                            Through my work with GAGE, I've successfully argued grievances that have won graduate workers back their hard-earned wages and leveraged our mutual aid and emergency aid funds to help cover emergency expenses
                            related to medical bills and broken technology. I also worked tagentially as the eyes and ears for non-labor related issues, providing guidance on academic disputes that have resulted in graduate students being
                            able to retain their visa status. I also co-organized workshops for graduate students on approaching difficult conversations and harnessing the potential energy of conflict to be generative instead of destructive.</p>
                        </p>
                        <p>Starting in 2021, I will be stepping into a nominated role as the Doctoral student representative on the Georgetown Collect Executive Committee of Graduate Studies (Grad-ExCo) which makes decisions on the implementation
                            and structure of new graduate programs at the university. I am excited to discover the ways in which this role can be used to push for an equitable and just landscape of graduate education.
