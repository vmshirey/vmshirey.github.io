									<h2>Perspective on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion</h2>
									<p>We all come to science with different backgrounds and identities; unforuntately, science has continued to exlude individuals with certain backgrounds from 
										participating as their whole selves, especially women, BIPOC, and LGBTQ+ individuals. As a queer, neurodivergent, and disabled scientist, I am intimately familiar 
										with the cis-heternormative and ableist aspects of science, especially biodiversity science, and how these systems can prevent broading participation and belonging in
										the field. Further, as academics, we must address the fact that science has been a profession built largely for white men from upper economic classes. Addressing both
										the social and material needs of students in our discipline is key to paving the way for an equitable future.
									</p>
									<p>Through my work as the grievance officer for my graduate workers' union at Georgetown University, I have worked to mediate dialogue and resolve conflict between graduate 
										workers, supervisors, administration, and Title IX officers. In this role, I also coordinate and direct graduate workers to mutual aid resources and have fostered the creation of
										an interim measures policy that allows workers who have been discriminated against or harassed to address that harm alongside lengthy Title IX investigations. Through this role I have
										facilitated the return of lost wages, helped graduate students retain student-visa status, and bolstered COVID-19 related protections. 
									</p>
									<p>In work extending beyond Georgetown, I am an active participant in the prison abolition community and have been a pen-pal to incarcerated LGBTQ+ and HIV+ prisoners across the country for 3
										years. I have also co-authored and participated in the founding of LGBTQ+ oriented presentations and organizations including The Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming Fieldwork Alliance. I am
										excited to see how this organization grows and about the opportunities to connect students and mentees to a broader network of LGBTQ+ scientists.  
									</p>
									<p>In future roles, I am excited to tap into the institutional power provided to me in order to make tangible strides forward in diversity, equity, and inclusion in biodiversity science. First and foremost,
										I believe that this entails the active recruitment and training of Historically excluded identities and socioeconomic classes. This includes conducting outreach to local schools and after-school programs,
										networking with professors at community colleges, and providing an actual living wage to graduate employees and research assistants at all levels. Diversity, equity, and inclusion work is more than diversifying 
										the material presented in the classroom, it is about showing up and putting work and resources to the cause. 
									</p>
