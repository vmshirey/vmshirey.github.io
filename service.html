									<h2>Perspective on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion</h2>
									<p>We all come to science with different backgrounds and identities; unfortunately, science has continued to exclude certain individuals from participating as their whole selves, 
										especially women, BIPOC, and LGBTQ+ people. The structures of sexism, racism, cis-heteronormativity, and economic disadvantage are pervasive in society and the acknowledgement 
										and dismantling of these systems starts with promoting equitable access and support in education and career development. Few professions have the opportunity to directly 
										target such social change, as both researchers and educators, faculty are well positioned to do so. 
									</p>
									<p>I have had the opportunity to engage with social justice and organizing activities mostly through my work as a labor organizer and the grievance officer for my graduate 
										workers’ union, the Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Employees (GAGE). Through organizing with GAGE and by serving as a member of the bargaining committee, I had the 
										opportunity to negotiate salaries for graduate workers across the campus which resulted in raising wages by as much as 44.4%. Economic hardship is one of the most 
										important barriers to diversity, equity, and inclusion work and intersects strongly with race, gender-identity, and sexual orientation. Further, in my role as the 
										grievance officer for GAGE, I am responsible for mediating conflict between graduate workers, supervisors, and university administration. In this position, I have also 
										made it my calling to serve as counsel and advocate for student/worker issues beyond the scope of our contract. This has advocacy resulted in the retention of student visa 
										status through mentor conflict and the creation of an alternative measures procedure that prioritizes immediate harm-reduction from harassment and discrimination during 
										ongoing and often lengthy Title IX investigations. Finally, in this role, I have co-facilitated a series of workshops for graduate workers aimed at providing emotional and 
										communication strategies for navigating conflict and harm.  
									</p>
									<p>Outside of the academic domain, I am an active participant in the realm of prison abolition and community-building. Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and continuing 
										today, I have leveraged Black + Pink (a non-profit organization focused on prison abolition and reintroduction for LGBTQ+ and HIV+ inmates) networks to connect with several 
										incarcerated individuals as pen-pals. My conversations with people who have engaged in some of the most harmful acts known to society have shifted my perspective on how 
										inequity can manifest in unfortunate situations and how the aforementioned systems of racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination can intersect to amplify inequity 
										in cycles of repeated exclusion and harm. Some of these conversations have been extremely difficult, but the parallels to my own lived experiences as someone who has been 
										excluded along aspects of my identity drive me to be a source of community for these inmates.
									</p>
									<p>My particular interest in conflict and harm-reduction stem from my experiences growing up as a queer, neurodivergent person in a hostile 
										educational environment. My science teachers were my heroes and the only people I could seek true solace in during some of the darkest parts of my life. Being that 
										person for someone else is the highest calling I could have in life, and I am committed to front-line advocacy for those in need. While increasing the diversity of 
										course materials, inviting speakers from diverse backgrounds to seminars, and citing work from diverse authors are all excellent strategies they represent, to me, a 
										minimum commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Instead, my past and future work in this sphere focuses on improving the immediate and long-term material and 
										ocial conditions of excluded groups in science. In future roles, I am inspired to have the institutional and material power to actively recruit and train women, BIPOC, 
										and LGBTQ+ individuals in cutting-edge and highly in-demand data science techniques. Further, I am committed to paying recruits above a living-wage while supporting their 
										professional development through workshop and speaking opportunities at the department and conference level. Throughout this commitment, I cannot emphasize enough the “power 
										of place” and how important it will be to actually embed myself in these communities in order to have high efficacy in my ability to recruit from these demographics. I am particularly interested in strengthening the community-college to research pipeline to meet this goal.
									</p>
									<p>Meeting diversity, equity, and inclusion outcomes further the quality of our science and professional communities, but more than that, they work towards bettering our sense 
										of belonging and community on the whole. My past and future work in this sphere is motivated by my experiences, engagement, and by my training and commitment to direct action, 
										harm-reduction, mediation, and community-building. In my view, the only way forward is together, and our sense of togetherness comes from strong networks of support and care.
