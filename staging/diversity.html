                <h2>Perspective on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives require direct action. In my roles as a <u><b>department organizer, bargaining committee member, and grievance officer for
                the <a href="https://www.wearegage.org/" target="_blank">Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Employees (GAGE)</a></b></u>, I know first-hand how conversation, coordination, and execution can make a difference in the lives
                of graduate workers. As a <a href="https://www.blackandpink.org/" target="_blank"><u><strong>penpal to incarcerated LGBTQ+ individuals</strong></u></a> I have gained insight into the complex sociological and economic issues behind harm, 
                punishment, reconciliation, and transformative justice. As a <u><b>political anarchist and abolitionist</b></u> I am committed to harm reduction, mutual aid, community building, and a decarceral philosophy. Finally,
                as a member of the broader queer, disabled, and neurodivergent community, my own experiences with harassment and discrimination inform my approach to DEI in the field.  
            </p>
            <p>These fundamental experiences lend themselves to several core approaches to diversity, equity, and inclusion in the field of biodiversity science, namely:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><u><b>Direct Action</b></u>: Authentic committment to DEI requires acting decisively with the consent and direction of marginalized individuals. Often this requires us to engage with conflict and uncomfortable
                        conversations. Equity demands that we show up along the axes of our majoritarian identities for those who are marginalized. Equity demands that we act. Further, in hindsight, the field of
                        biology has to achieve reconciliation given its trouble history across all subdisciplines. </li>
                    <li><u><b>Community Building</b></u>: Direct action is impossible without strong communities. Communities in which people feel a sense of belonging and assurance that they are protected by the power of the 
                        collective. I have worked extensively to build community across my various roles. Firstly, through GAGE, I have worked to organize workshops on navigating difficult conversations and conflict. My
                        friendship with incarcerated penpals has opened by perspective on who needs community in order to heal and how I might fit into organzing that broader sense of communities for those who are not
                        able to cultivate healthy relationships for themselves.</li>
                    <li><u><b>Harm Reduction</b></u>: Harm happens and each of our responses provides a critical juncture from which we can choose to act according to our values. As the elected grievance officer for GAGE
                        during two consecutive terms, I fought to earn graduate workers benefits, win back unpaid wages, facilitate discussions which resulted in non-termination of visa status, and direct graduate workers to resources
                        to support them financially through hardship.</li>
                </ul>
